Hello, welcome to my website!

My name is Damien.
I am currently an incoming MSc student in the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/).

I am driven by a deep passion for research aimed at solving the one of the pressing global challenges of our time - the energy crisis. I hope to be a part of the research community aimed at exploring innovative and sustainable solutions to bring us closer to a cleaner and brighter future.
