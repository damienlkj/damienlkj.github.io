Hello, welcome to my website!

My name is Damien.
I am currently a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student in the [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).

I am driven by a deep passion for research aimed at solving the one of the pressing global challenges of our time -- the energy crisis. I hope to be a part of the research community aimed at exploring innovative and sustainable solutions to bring us closer to a cleaner and brighter future.
